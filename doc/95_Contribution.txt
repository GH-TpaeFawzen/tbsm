Contributions to tbsm
=======================

General Notes
---------------
Send patches in any way you like with any identity you prefer. I use only Linux
with X/KDE/Plasma and will not test code for other systems. But I would accept
patches for what ever system as long as it not break my box.

  - Try to follow the existent look of the code
  - There is a .kateconfig file in the source root. Should you use an other
    editor that support .editorconfig feel free to add such file and make a PR
  - Don't use under_scores, use camelCase
  - Place the open brace { of a function not on an own line
  - Don't spick the code with your copyright hints as long as you not introduce
    some new file. If so, add my hint at the top
  - Try to follow the existent commit message style. Avoid too long lines, use
    imperative form, try to describe why in favor of what


Update po/pot Files After Code Changes
----------------------------------------
When you are done with you patch, check if you have changed or added user
readable strings. Only then run 'make update-po'. When your change consist of
only one commit, add the changes of the po-files to this commit.

Should your change consist of more commits add an own commit for the po-file
changes like this:

  i18n: Change-to: <your feature/patch description>


Update Translations To Fit Code Changes
-----------------------------------------
Once some hacker has changed something, some translator need to care that the
translation files are in sync with the code, meaning the translation still work.

Commit the changes to some po-file like this:

  i18n: <locale>-fix-to: <feature/patch description>
  i18n: pt_BR-fix-to: <feature/patch description>

Ensure that your 'fix-to:' commit match some 'Change-to:' commit, in sence of
content and <feature/patch description>.


Add A New Translation
-----------------------
Start a new translation in your favorite translation tool (poedit, gtranslator
or whatever) using 'locale/tbsm.pot' as template.

But you can also just copy the template file and modify that new file in your
prefered editor.

  cp locale/tbsm.pot locale/${LANG}.po

Fill in the header and the translation lines and commit your work with the
message:

  i18n: Add <language/country> translation file
  i18n: Add Portuguese/Brazilian translation file

Feel free to translate as you like, don't try eager to be equally worded, be
creative as long as the message of your text fit the situation.


Some Background Info For The Noob
-----------------------------------
The po/pot files are composed by a series of blocks, each block being related to
a string. E.g.:

  #: src/tbsm:376 src/tbsm:378 src/tbsm:401
  msgid "Path not found"
  msgstr "Caminho n√£o encontrado"

The first line lists the references. It's where that string can be found on the
source code. The second line is the string exactly as it appears on the source
code. Third one is the translation.
