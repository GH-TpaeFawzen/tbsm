1- Introduction
=================
tbsm is an application or session launcher, written in pure bash with no
ncurses or dialog dependencies. He is inspired by cdm, tdm, in some way by
krunner and related.

To became an overview of available options run:
  tbsm help

It was attempted to design the behavior of tbsm to be as less pesky as possible,
and to start daily tasks with as less key strokes.

To do so, tbsm saves the last run session and a default session. These both are
available by the quick menu where you can start the default session by simply
hit <enter> or the last session when you delete the bang ! previous. You can run
there any command tbsm knows without to remove the bang.

You reach the quick menu from the full session menu by hitting <enter> on an
empty prompt. To go back you have to give the needed command which is 'm'.

You should know that there is not really any special at the 'full session menu'.
It is only a pimped out listing of your tbsm configuration where as the commands
'search' and 'list' show a poor list. In any way you can use the listed index
numbers as argument for any command you like.

May you have a nice day, I run now 'q'


2- Things Of Interest
=======================
He only works with .desktop files to start something, there is no other config
possible.

When running tbsm without any argument he is scanning for available .desktop
files in /usr/share/xsessions/ and $configDir/whitelist but skip any file
referenced in $configDir/blacklist. Whereas $configDir is ~/.config/tbsm.

When searching for any pattern he run a grep with the pattern on all .desktop
files in /usr/share/applications/

The first session ever started became the default session.


3- Post Install Tasks
=======================
To auto start tbsm after login edit your ~/.bash_profile, or similar, and append
to the end something like:

  # Auto start tbsm after login on first two VTs
  [[ $XDG_VTNR -le 2 ]] && tbsm

NOTE: Ensure you start no other display manager


3-1- Customizing
------------------
Take a look at /etc/xdg/tbsm/tbsm.conf and subfolders.
Create your own theme files in ~/.config/tbsm/themes.
