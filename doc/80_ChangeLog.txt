2016-01-19  v0.1  [YANKED]
=======================================

          Hello World!

Aside from all bling-bling there are some things to note about removed code from
CDMs original which may make tbsm not yet a replacement of CDM for you:

- There is no search for next empty VT
- There is no check if X is already running somewhere
- There is no SPAWN set or checked
- And maybe something else removed which I forgot to mention

so you are warned.
But it is getting worse: This very first version is not very well tested!

Anyway have fun,
Lothar
